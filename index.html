    <h3>Bio</h3>
        <article>Hello my name is Lupita! I am a fourth year Design Major here at Western Washington University. I am minoring in Illustration and frequently incorporate it into my work. My schedule is always packed so I'm always staying up late at night finishing assignments. This means my refrigerator is always packed with Red Bull energy drinks, particularly the Peach Edition flavor which has become my all time favorite of their line of flavors. I would consider myself an energy drink connoisseur. One of my hobbies is trying a new energy drink everytime I visit the grocery store. Brands that I try range from the iconic Monster and Redbull to MtnDew Energy and Alani that are less known. This winter break I've taken some time to expand my hobbies and have taken up embroidery and hand poke tattooing. Both involving needles, I really want to deep dive into hand poke tattoos and learn the art. Having a design background, I am confident that my skills will translate well.</article>
